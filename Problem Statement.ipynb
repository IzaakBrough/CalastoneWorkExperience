    "## Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "A client of Calastone's has been harvesting its users' transactional debit card spending (in a GDPR compliant way of course). The data is valuable. However, the client is not very clever, and they don't know how to get any insight from the data AT ALL. They have hired YOU to give them some interesting stats about the data. It seems like some people are responsible with their money and other people struggle to manage it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Along with this Calastone has interesting data about Mutual Funds. It contains weekly prices for real funds from 2020 until now and also some descriptive properties of each fund. It might be possible to work out the performance of a fund from the price data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps there is a way these two cool sources of data could be combined to help the client's customers, and also to make some money!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your app should visualize some part of this data, and use that visualization to make some inference or recommendation.\n",
