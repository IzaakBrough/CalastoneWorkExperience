    "\n",
    "A client of Calastone's has been harvesting its users' debit card spending (in a GDPR compliant way of course). The data is valuable. However the client is not very clever, and they don't know how to get any insight from the data AT ALL. They have hired YOU to give them some interesting stats about the data. It seems like some people are responsible with their money and other people struggle to manage it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Along with this Calastone has interesting data about Mutual Funds. Perhaps there is a way these two cool sources of data could be combined to help the client's customers, and also to make some money!\n",
